## BackUp/CleanUp/Organize your VB project

### Description

Update:2/15/05 - This application will scan both VBP and VBG project files. It will copy or move all the files referenced in a project file(s) to a project folder of your choosing, either new or current, and update the project file(s) with the new file locations. User Options Include: - Leave your existing project intact by creating a new project folder to copy the files to, - Move all your project files to a new project folder, - Update your current project by copying all referenced files not currently in your project’s folder to your project’s folder, - Organizes your project files by placing them in separate sub-folders, - Copy or Move any sub-folders that are currently in your project’s folder, - Copy or Move any miscellaneous (non VB) files like graphics, databases, and sound files that are in the same folder as the project file(s), - Delete empty folders, - Copy only newer files, - Prompt before overwriting existing files.

No more submitting that perfect project to PSC, with high hopes, only to get e-mails back saying that your zipped project is missing files.

This project comes as a standard exe or a VB6 add-in. It also supports command line so that you can create a shortcut to this application and place it into your “Send To” folder, giving you the ability to open projects from Windows Explorer.

This is a complete project; meaning that error and data entry checks have been included along with warning messages and other user feedback. I have run extensive tests to make it as bug free as possible. Any comments or ideas for additional features would be greatly appreciated.

PLEASE VIEW THE READ_ME FILE.
